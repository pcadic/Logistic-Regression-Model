Building of logistic regression model to predict if an Amtrack customer is ‘Satisfied’ with the train service.
Exploratory Data Analysis : Identify which features are most important for the model. Describe the relationship between significant predictor variables and the target variable.
Data Preparation and Model Development:
•	Impute data for attributes that have missing values which are used in the model.
•	Use dummy variables for categorical variables.
•	Dropping rows of data is not permitted.
•	Use of scaling to check if we get better results or not.
•	Ensure that all model features are significant using the chi test.
Model Evaluation :
•	Perform cross fold vqlidqtion:
•	Show a summary of accuracy, precision, recall, f1 scores
•	Show a confusion matrix.
•	After all folds, show the average and standard deviation for all accuracy, precision, recall, f1 scores.
